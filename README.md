# Creative Coding Projects
First, I just want to say welcome to my first public repository!

Second, the projects within this repo are from a class I took at the University of Oregon in 2022: Creative Coding taught by John Park. This was the first programming class I had taken since high school 
(shout out to Project Lead the Way), which really sparked my interest in programming

## Software
[Processing](https://processing.org/), an open-source software for artists, was used to write and run java code! 

## Projects

### [dataVisualization.pde](dataVisualization/dataVisualization.pde)

Description: During the COVID-19 Pandemic, US federal healthcare organizations included the LGBTQ+ community in some of the criteria for accessing the early Covid vaccinations and it was not really talked about. Medical offices collect demographic information of patients. Prior to COVID19, and even now, the research about social minorities and health risks has been very minimal. In the doctor's office answering demograpic information honestly, if it feels safe and open to, can lead to further research in public health.

### [soundProject.pde](soundProject/soundProject.pde)

Description: This projects analyzes a few tweets from politicans. It feels on par with how that sounds. Below are the tweets in the form which can be read by the rest of the code. When a word with a negative connotation is read, a negative sound plays (and visa versa with good sounds). Searching for these tweets, the first three were found by googling "Top [name] Tweets" and searching through them for something that seemed to talk about the individual as a person rather than their views as a political figure. The last two pairs below were the term "trans" searched on well-known politcal figures (with opposing ideas) twitter profiles.

### [threeDimentional.pde](threeDimentional/threeDimentional.pde)

This project features a lot of little pouches made from distorted and replicated rings. Sort of in a flower way, but if printed large enough a little home for succulents.

### [Game.pde](Game/Game.pde)

Description: The objective of this game is to jump across the screen on the lily pads. The frog cannot jump backwards.
