# Creative Coding Projects
First, I just want to say welcome to my first public repository!

Second, the projects within this repo are from a class I took at the University of Oregon in 2022: Creative Coding taught by John Park. This was the first programming class I had taken since high school 
(shout out to Project Lead the Way), which really sparked my interest in programming

## Software
[Processing](https://processing.org/), an open-source software for artists, was used to write and run java code! 

## Projects

### [dataVisualization.pde](dataVisualization/dataVisualization.pde)

Description: During the COVID-19 Pandemic, US federal healthcare organizations included
the LGBTQ+ community in some of the criteria for accessing the early Covid vaccinations
and it was not really talked about. Medical offices collect demographic information of 
patients. Prior to COVID19, and even now, 
the research about social minorities and health risks has been very minimal. 
In the doctor's office answering demograpic information honestly, if it feels safe and open to,
can lead to further research in public health.
