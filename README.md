# Creative Coding Projects
First, I just want to say welcome to my first public repository!

Second, the projects within this repo are from a class I took at the University of Oregon in 2022: Creative Coding taught by John Park. This was the first programming class I had taken since high school 
(shout out to Project Lead the Way), which really sparked my interest in programming

## Software
[Processing](https://processing.org/), an open-source software for artists, was used to write and run java code!
